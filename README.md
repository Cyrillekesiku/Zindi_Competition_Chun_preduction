# Zindi_Competition_Chun_preduction
Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with mobile data and calling plans. The objective of this challenge is to develop a self-learning model to predict the probability that each Expresso customer will "leave the network", i.e. become inactive and not perform any transactions (e.g. incoming calls, outgoing calls, mobile data usage, ...) for 90 days.

This solution will help Expresso better serve its customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving the network and therefore act accordingly to retain them.
